# FLASK-APP-pro

FLASK-APP-pro is a basic Python-based web application built using the Flask framework. It provides a foundational structure for developing web applications, including essential configurations, route definitions, and dependency management.

## Features

- **Flask Framework**: Utilizes Flask for web development, offering simplicity and flexibility.
- **Structured Codebase**: Organized project structure.
- **Dependency Management**: Manages dependencies through `requirements.txt` for consistent environment setup.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following key files:

- `pro.py`: The main application file where routes and application configurations are defined.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the application.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
